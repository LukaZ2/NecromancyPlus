A simple mod that helps you with necromancy in Hypixel Skyblock.

⭐Features⭐

- Displays the mana costs of your souls in the Soul-Menu
- Dropped souls have nametags
- Confirmation button when removing your soul from necromancy weapons
- Intelligence optimizer module


⚠️Known Issues⚠️

- Dropped soul nametags does not work in dungeons. Why? In dungeons mobs dissapear instantly when they are about to die and the mod can't confirm if a mob died or not. I am working on a solution and every idea will be appriciated.
